#Brainiac
Brainiac Is A Library For Artificial Intelligence Programming. It Currently Contains A Couple Of Modules That Do Misc. Things. One Module Is A Dictionary With A Function The Finds The Definition Of Any Given Word(Find(Word)). As Well As A Writer Module Which Takes As Input A String A Ouputs An Image Of That String In My Handwriting. GPL License.Eventually It Is Going To Be A Full Fledged System Of AI Components, Unfortunately At The Moment It Is Just A Couple Of My **Handwritten Data Sets**, Along With A Little Code To Do Cool Things With It.

If You Know Anything About Python Programming, ANSI C Programming, Artificial Intelligence Theory, Linguistic Analysis, Find A Bug, Or Anything Else, Any Help Is Much Appreciated
